          <h3 class="">Abstract</h3>
          <p class="">Sustainable mobility refers to the use of either non-polluting travel methods (e.g., walking or cycling), collective travel methods (e.g., bus, train, or car-pooling) or low-pollution travel means (e.g., electrical cars). 
            The goal of this project is to design a mid-fidelity prototype of a system that would encourage
            people to increase their use of sustainable mobility options, since most of times they’re not the
            most suitable choice for everyday life. </p>
            <p class="">Users will record their sustainable movements in our system to earn points. They can exchange
            points with rewards.</p> 
            <p class="">There are several parties in this project, and each party has different needs. Our goal was to
            see how various types of people, from the young student to the old lady, deal with the use of
            sustainable means of transport in everyday life, in order to understand what they liked and
            disliked about it.</p> 
            <p class="">We decided to focus on the Trentino region: this area has few big cities and inhabitants of the
            mountain valleys need to reach them both for working and leisure purposes. For this reason, 
            we were able to work with a good sample of people, with many different needs. This allowed us
            to have a deeper understanding of what the real problem is and a more focused view on the
            possible solution that we’re going to describe in this report.</p>  
            <p class="">Relying on the interviews we conducted, our aim was to understand how we could encourage a
            larger number of people to prefer using a sustainable transportation method rather than their
            private car or motorbike. Although there are some critical flaws about sustainable mobility
            from the users’ point of view, we think we could find a good compromise: all the people need is
            a good reward for their good action towards environment, and that’s what our project is all
            about.</p>

          <h3 class="">Our idea</h3>
          <p class="">We focused on daily movements of people only in the area of Trento. Our system will award
            users with points. Users may redeem them from bus and train tickets, and bike sharing
            reservations, since everything is associated with a unique code.  </p>
            <p class="">Points will be awarded based on the mean of transport used. We provide some 
            examples:<br> 
            Bus: 10 points/km<br> 
            Train: 10 points/km<br> 
            Bike: 13 points/km<br> 
            Walk: 15 points/km<br> 
            Maximum points per day: 150</p>
            <p class="">We decided to assign points based on the means’ sustainability. Riding the bike awards the
            user less points than walking, even though sustainability is the same, because you can cover
            longer distances. Bus and train give the same points per km because they limit CO2 emissions
            in the same quantity.</p>  
             
            <p class="">When travelling by train or bus, the system starts the GPS tracking after scanning the QR
            located on the vehicle. Via GPS the system understands when you leave the bus/train and gives
            you the points.</p>  
            <p class="">When walking or riding the bike the user must manually start and stop the GPS tracking in
            order to obtain the points. The tracking stops automatically if the users forgets about it
            because it can see if he/she is stationary for too long or if he/she is no longer near a railroad or
            a bus path. </p>
