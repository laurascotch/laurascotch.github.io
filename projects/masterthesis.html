                        <p><i>A brief presentation of my MSc degree thesis</i>
                        </p>

                        <p class=""> This project is the subject of the final dissertation for the MSc in Computer Science at University of Trento, Italy. The final elaborate is titled <i><b>"Implementing and running the Digital
                            Twin of a network for energy
                            consumption monitoring and optimization"</b></i> and covers three main topics:
                            <ul>
                                <li> - The problem of energy consumption in network architectures</li>
                                <li> - Proposal of the structure of a Digital Twin of a network for traffic monitoring and energy-wise optimization
                                </li>
                                <li> - Development of the prototype of the D.T. and results achieved</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <h3>The problem of energy consumption</h3>
                        <p>When speaking about the costs of a network, we can divide them into two main parts: the capital expenditures (CapEx) and the operational expenses (OpEx). Various >10 years projections estimate that in general the OpEx can amount
                            to as much as 9 times the CapEx.<br></p>
                        <p>In particular, many reports show that an important part of the OpEx is due to the cost of energy needed by the network. This slice usually ranges between 15% and 50%.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/master/huaweiopex.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; background-color: white">
                        <p>The energy can be further divided in two parts: that needed by the structures (e.g. lighting in datacenters, cooling systems, etc.) and that needed by the network devices in order to work.</p>
                        <p>It has been observed that up to half of the energy consumption of a general network device (e.g. switch) is due to the number of active interfaces. More in details, studies [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4509688"
                                target="_blank">1</a>] [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-23041-7_28" target="_blank">2</a>] demonstrated that the amount is strictly related to the working bit rate of each port, while being almost independent of
                            the amount of traffic traversing it. In other words, once a cable is inserted in an interface and the LED status lights up, that port is consuming energy.
                        </p>
                        <p>If we define as <i>idle</i> the interfaces that are active (i.e. wired and up) but aren't forwarding any traffic, it sounds logical that putting them in a temporary sleep mode or lowering their bit rate could be effective in terms
                            of energy saving. In fact, some mechanisms for per-interface sleeping already exist (ALR and LPI), however the problem is that the device should be aware of them, otherwise the modified, and unsupported, L2 frame would cause
                            the packet to be dropped.</p>
                        <p>Software Defined Networking offers the tools needed to exploit such strategies in a way that could be hardware independent, provided that the switches/routers support the SDN paradigm.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the ultimate goal of this project is to propose a way of implementing and running the Digital Twin of a network in order to:
                            <ul>
                                <li> - monitor the traffic per-interface</li>
                                <li> - adapt the bit rate of each interface depending on the traffic volume</li>
                            </ul>
                            In particular, the Digital Twin proposed is developed in a modular way, so that any optimization algorithm can be developed and easily integrated with the data structures composing the Digital Twin itself.</p>

                        <h3 class="">The Digital Twin</h3>
                        <h4>What is a Digital Twin?</h4>
                        <p class="">A digital twin is a real-time simulation of a real-world system (physical twin). The digital twin serves as a counterpart of the real twin and allows for modeling present and future scenarios based on a model that is constantly
                            updated with real and live data. </p>
                        <p>Digital Twins are used in a large number of areas, from the aerospace industry to economics. This project focuses on a possible use in the telecommunications field.</p>
                        <p>One of the biggest challenges when developing a Digital Twin is dealing with the huge amount of data a system can generate. It is important to clearly define what the goal is, so that the effort is focused only on the needed data:
                            bigger quantities require bigger resources to allow for real-time gathering and analysis.</p>
                        <h4>The main idea</h4>
                        <p>The main idea at the core of this project is that the Digital Twin can be seen as a puzzle: at the base there are the data structures and the main code, and on top of it routing, monitoring and optimization algorithm can be easily
                            integrated.
                        </p>
                        <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/master/puzzle.jpg" style="height: auto; width: auto; background-color: white;">
                        <p>Despite the main goal being that of providing a solid and efficient "base piece" of the puzzle, in combination with the monitoring "piece", I also developed some simple algorithms addressing the routing and the actual optimization
                            problem, so to have a complete software that can be run in order to gather some results from testing environments.</p>
                        <h4>Representing the network</h4>
                        <p>The biggest problem when developing a D.T. is to find a smart way of representing the real system, that highlights just the features of interest. Since we need to act on the single interfaces in order to optimize their energy consumption,
                            what I propose is an "interface-centric" model of the network.</p>
                        <p>The first and most complete way I came up with was that of representing the network as a graph where each node was an interface, and then cluster them up depending on the belonging to the switches. However this would be too complex
                            to handle with large interfaces, so in the end the network is represented by a graph where the switches are the nodes, but what is important is the list of edges. Each edge, which represents a couple of wired ports, is then
                            enriched with information that is interface specific. Ultimately all of this is what is stored and constantly updated in the data structures composing the D.T.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/master/grafi.jpg" style="height: auto; width: inline-block; background-color: white;">
                        <h4>Routing, monitoring and optimization</h4>
                        <p>As anticipated, all the pieces of the puzzle were implemented in order to have a functioning D.T. prototype.</p>
                        <p>Since a generic mesh topology will be used as testbed, it is necessary to break the loops in the network in order for it to work. To do so, a simple way of calculating the spanning tree was implemented. The spanning tree of the
                            network is defined via a BFS visit of the graph, with the root being chosen as the switch that has the highest number of connections to other switches (its degree), combined with an important number of connections to terminal
                            hosts. This is an attempt at having as few active links as possible, in order to maximize the energy saving with relation to usage.</p>
                        <p>The execution of the BFS-ST allows for the first definition of the interfaces’ status: they are now either in <i>disabled</i> or <i>idle</i> state. The status of an idle interface may change to <i>working</i> or <i>saturated</i>                            during the execution of the D.T. The difference between <i>working</i> and <i>saturated</i> is that a saturated port is a port that is working above a certain threshold of traffic volume.</p>
                        <p>Such threshold is defined as <i>SENSITIVITY * port_speed</i> where SENSITIVITY is a percentage decided a priori of the amount of traffic exchanged in a time unit at 1Mbps. E.g. if the digital twin time unit lasts 1 second and it
                            is decided that if the link is half full , it needs more bitrate, the sensitivity will be 62500 B (50% of 1Mbps in 1s).</p>
                        <p>The status of the port, updated at each time unit based on the traffic monitoring, together with the amount of time a port has been in that status, determine if its bit rate must be changed.</p>
                        <p>The logic at the base of the optimization algorithm is greedy and kind of naive, and can be summed up as follows:
                            <ul>
                                <li> - port_status = working --> keep current bit rate</li>
                                <li> - port_status = saturated --> more bit rate</li>
                                <li> - port_status = idle --> minimal bit rate</li>
                            </ul>
                            The choice when the port status is idle was either between 0 bit rate (sleep mode) or minimal, but since the energy required in the second case is very low, it was chosen to keep the link alive for availability of service.</p>
                        <p>As anticipated, also the amount of time spent in a certain status is considered. It is important to find good values for it (or a good strategy to determine them) in order to have a D.T. that is just as reactive as needed.</p>
                        <p>Just to give an example of what the wrong values may cause, let’s consider the case where the D.T. gives more bit rate as soon as the status changes to saturated: if it is just a local peak that ends in the span of a single time
                            unit, giving more bit rate would be a waste of energy since the link was already capable to handle the flow.</p>

                        <h3 class=""><br><br>Actual implementation and testing</h3>
                        <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/master/environment.jpg" style="height: auto; width: inline-block; background-color: white;">
                        <p class="">Since I didn’t have a real physical network to test the execution of the Digital Twin, I emulated one using Mininet, an open-source framework for network architectures emulation that supports the SDN paradigm.</p>
                        <p>I then used Ryu as SDN controller and in the end the Digital Twin is one of the SDN applications that execute on top of the controller.</p>
                        <p><b>DISCLAIMER</b> - Mininet comes with an important limitation: the physical interfaces are emulated by virtual Ethernet interfaces, and the speed of this kind of interfaces is hardcoded in the Linux kernel to be 10 Gbps (<a href="https://mailman.stanford.edu/pipermail/mininet-discuss/2015-January/005633.html"
                                target="_blank">source</a>). Since it would be impractical to modify the Linux kernel, the solution proposed uses traffic control and quality of service mechanisms to emulate the actual change of bit rate of the interfaces.</p>
                        <p>The following diagram shows the main code flow of the developed Digital Twin, highlighting how the data structures are updated and used in the decision-making process.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/master/codice.jpg" style="height: auto; width: inline-block; background-color: white;">
                        <p>The software was developed in Python and interacts with the SDN controller via the REST API that Ryu provides.</p>
                        <h4>Simulation parameters</h4>
                        <p>In order to estimate the energy required by each port at a certain bit rate, I used the table provided in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-23041-7_28">this paper</a> (and shown below). The values are really close to real
                            ones that can be estimated by averaging the data sheets of various commercial switches by real vendors.</p>

                        <p>All the simulation runs were executed under the same “external” conditions:
                            <ul>
                                <li> - 60 cycles (cycle duration ~ 3’’)</li>
                                <li> - same traffic pattern and volume (emulated via iPerf)</li>
                                <li> - same network topology (BFS-ST always returns the same result)</li>
                                <li> - Base power for each switch: 20 W - just for plotting reasons (aesthetics...)</li>
                            </ul>
                            The figure below shows the topology used. The blue links are those that get selected by BFS-ST. Notice how no links are selected towards switch 2: this happens because it would be a leaf (connected to s4) with no terminal hosts, and no traffic should
