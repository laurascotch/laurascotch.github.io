          <h3 class="">Abstract</h3>
          <p class="">This laboratory lecture was designed to present the main characteristics of honeypots and describe some of their different existing implementation. After a first introductory part to the topic, we (my teammates and me) showed some possible practical applications of two open source honeypots, namely Cowrie and Dionaea. The proposed exercises on their relevant aspects were later followed by a final discussion, regarding further and more realistic usage of honeypots with a curious one sometimes employed by law enforcement.</p>

          <p class="">What is interesting to note is that, before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the lab lectures (all of them presented by the students) were held in a Lab at University of Trento with a fully set up subnet in order to recreate ad hoc scenarios.</p>
          <p class="">Since the pandemic, the lectures were held remotely and we couldn't access the Lab. For this reason, we had to work with various virtual machines, in particular using iptables in order to set up the network scenario we needed to run the lecture.</p>
